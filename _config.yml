description: "As a determined puzzle solver, you can give me a problem and I will solve it. Adapting to any situation is something I am always pushing myself, and my teammates, to do. Thinking around, on top, underneath, and sometimes in the box, keeps me on my toes; ready to succeed and help others on the way."
